## Minimal Node Server for Google Voice Assistant

This is a minimal version of <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/actions-on-google-api-ai-boilerplate" target="_blank">https://glitch.com/edit/#!/actions-on-google-api-ai-boilerplate</a> ; I've removed files as long as it still gives a response to API.AI, and I've trimmed down and rephrased things in server.js to make it shorter and hopefully easier to see the bare bones/flow.

## How to Use It:

Only 2 or 3 really essential files: **server.js** and **package.json**. And *LICENCE.md*.

Go to <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/minimal-node-server-for-google-assistant?path=README.md:1:0" target="_blank">https://glitch.com/edit/#!/minimal-node-server-for-google-assistant?path=README.md:1:0</a> and remix it to get your own copy to tailor for your app's webhook.

Build a Google Assistant app using Actions on Google, API.AI, and a Glitch-based Node.js (Express) webhook server.
